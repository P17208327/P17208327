#Assignment
for my assignment I have created a website about a game called Tekken7
like playing Tekken 7 on different platforms and have played its previous versions of the game as a kid.

The website has 2 different styles that apply to different devices one is mobile phones and the other is desktop which changes the websites layout depending on what device the website is being viewed on. The whole website is made up of 5 webpages each describing the game in depth depending on which webpage is selected.

#Homepage
this page is the main page of the website from having a basic information about the game from what devices can
be used to play the game to what the game is about such as backstory

#Character Page
this page describes all the characters in the game currently with a description on there backstory's with images on what each character looks like.

#Guides Page
The guides page was created to aid players in getting to know the basic commands of the game with applying tips and tricks they
can learn.

#Review Page
Reviews are always valued to any website and game it helps to show approval of the game with getting people a better understanding
when players buy the game, the reviews are rated by top gaming companies.

#form page
this page allows users who view the website to rate the game so that other members of the public can comment on there opinions. To access this page is only via the "Review Form" button, The form page has an interactive rating system that allows users to click on a certain star icon to rate the game out of 5. The text area is able to apply text but does not save what the user wrote.

#website features
1. Sticky menu bar: this menu bar is designed at the bottom of each webpage allowing the user to swap between webpages without going back to the top of the page and accessing other features where ever the user wants.

2. dark mode: This is a slider button icon that changes the websites background to a darker colour allowing certain users who may prefer the website to be in a different style or have difficulty seeing in a certain colour.
