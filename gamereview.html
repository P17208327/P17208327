    <h2>IGN Review</h2>
    <p class="R-content"> Underneath the excellent cosmetics, some tweaks have been made to the combat mechanics that should encourage newbies.
      (If you’re a newbie you might not understand this – but that’s okay, you don’t need to benefit from these changes).
      Relative to the phenomenal Tekken 6, sidestepping here is slower and not as useful for baits or defense, while forward and back movement is
      improved. This places more emphasis on short and middle ranges, which feels more comfortable for those approaching Tekken from experience
      with spacing-focused games in Street Fighter or King of Fighters. While sidestepping is slightly less useful and no longer a universal weapon
      against certain characters who lack strong tracking attacks, careful and expert usage can still open up opportunities to capitalize on mistakes.
      It also helps characters with traditionally slower sidesteps like King or Paul to not feel so disadvantaged in defense.

    <h2>EuroGamer Review</h2>
    <p class="R-content"> I actually had a decent amount of fun with the character customisation side of Tekken 7, and enjoyed dressing my Ling Xiaoyu out in
      increasingly bonkers clothes and accessories. There's a huge amount to customise across the board. You can unlock everything from new
      health bars to new items you wear on your back (I picked a pizza because why not?). At the very least, customisation gives you something
      to shoot for on the single-player side of things, but for me the real benefit is adding variety to online play. There's so much to unlock,
      you're unlikely to see the same look twice online, and there's a lot of scope to made your player card stand out.

    <h2>PC Gamer review</h2>
    <p class="R-content"> When Tekken 7 comes alive, it does so with a furious zest and capability. With another invested player in tow,
      it delivers a gratifying, hard-hitting time with the winsome giddiness of a party game. And if you’re willing to put in the work required to
      release that power—and have the friends on-hand to help—then I'd recommend it, no question. If your fight buddies are thin on the ground, though,
      and the faceless world of online scrapping isn’t for you, think carefully. Tekken 7 quickly ceases to exist for the solo player.
