    <h2>MOVEMENT</h2>
    <p class="G-content">TEKKEN 7 is an immersive 3D fighting game that tests a player's reflex, skill and mental prowess within the environmental battlefield of game play.
      One of the most basic of all skills you'll need to make use of in T7 is MOVEMENT.
      Movement itself is the easiest concept to grasp within the game system, however it can also become the most critical in terms of execution,
      knowledge and application. The way you move in TEKKEN can create opportunities for you to demolish the opposition or it can limit the amount of
      risks when going into unknown territory. There are so many factors when it comes to the game play and movement, so let's start with the basics.

    <h2>3D SPACE</h2>
    <p class="G-content">TEKKEN 7 allows you to move around on the playing field seamlessly. Whether you're sidestepping to evade, dashing forward to advance or
      holding back to defend, the controls in TEKKEN allow you to truly immerse yourself in the virtual space within the fight.

    <h2>SPECIAL MOVEMENTS</h2>
    <p class="G-content">Many characters have special movement options such as a crouch dash, a sway back, or a special sidestep.
      These movement options often lead towards attacks and move options that you normally don't have access to from the standing position.
      It is important to know your character movement and move list options and explore their use when picking your arsenal of moves to use when
      playing against opponents.
